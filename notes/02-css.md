background-image: url() can let you set a background image
if nothings in the row height: #vh (view height) will let the image show
min-height will allow height to grow when screen size changes

background-size: cover; will stretch the image to the row
background-position: bottom/center/etc; will change the focal point of the image
backdrop-filter: blur(#px); will add blur to your background-color
add opacity to your background-color to make blur work
-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(10px); will allow websites that don't support blur to have it
webkit's for specific things help had support

position: ; will allow you to set your position of your objects such as a button, image, text etc
position: absolute; will position relative to the element its nested in i think
top: #; left: #; bottom: #; right: #; will let you move in in those directions
position: relative; will do something else, maybe ask what it does

utility classes are classes that only do a single thing
example: class="justify-center" if you make that class only justify center you can add it to multiple div classes instead of each individually

use google fonts to get custom fonts, on the website copy and past the link html tag and put in the head
make a font utility class and paste the other command from the website in there

@media(max-height #px /max-width: #px){
.hero-image{ 
background-image: url()}

.shopbutton{
 text-align: center;
}
}

this will change the background image depending on if the screen size changes to the parameters you set
media rules should be defined at the bottom of your style sheet so it isn't overridden by your other code
try to write media rules in tandem with bootstrap so they apply at the same breakpoints

this will also center the button when it goes to mobile view at the same time it changes the background image
