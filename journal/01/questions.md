# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | Git provides a hub to store your code on making it easier for multiple developers to work on a project,
    store content and letting you look back at your previous work |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | make directory |

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | a class that defines a special state of an element, we'll probably use hover  |

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | specificity is the order in which the code will choose what to display. You can use it to your benefit by 
    making what you want to show more specific |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | if you use it to much the code might not know what to display and do something you dont want  |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | selectors, properties, values |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | good design makes people to stay on your website and do what you intended them to do. Through design you can convey where people should look, what they should and how they should do it |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | creating a mock website so you have an outline of what your making before you make it |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | yes, they greatly speed up the coding process because instead of coming up where things go on the spot you have something to reference throughout the process |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | displays elements from left to right instead of the default up and down |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | height and width |
